# Introduction

The Thingsml library helps you create and parse [senml documents](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8428)
in both json and [cbor format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049).

# Documentation

# Key features

- Object oriented design. 
- Built in support for [senml's unit registry](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-senml-12#section-12.1) 
- Extensible for new data types
- Makes use of (but doesn't restrict to) ThingsML predefined list of record names via ThingsML indices.
- Direct support to read/write in json and cbor format.
- Automatically adjusts record data with respect to base time, base value & base sum.
- The library is optimized for devices with restricted memory requirements (runs on AVR systems with 1KB ram).
